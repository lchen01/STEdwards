  * **Location**: You'll need to choose where to install your new application. You can install it at the root of your domain or in a subdomain (which you need to set up first). In addition, you can place your application in a folder (in either your root domain or a subdomain)
  * **Version Information**: You can choose a version of the application. Generally, we recommend choosing the default version. It is likely to be the most recent, stable release.
  * **Updates & Database Management**: By default, the system is set up to automatically upgrade (and create backups upon upgrading) all applications. In addition, by default, the database will be set up for you automatically. //We recommend NOT changing these options//.
  * **Username/Password**: An username/password will be automatically generated for you. You can choose to change this, if you like.
  * **Website Title**: Pick a title for the site that will be created when you install your application. You should change this from the default title! After installation, you'll be taken back to the main Installatron page, with details about the application you just installed. At anytime you can come back here to review the application details, back it up manually, or uninstall it.
