====== Understanding Create OU's Accounts & Passwords ======

One aspect of create.ou.edu that users may find a bit complicated at first is understanding the different accounts (and associated passwords) that you can manage as part of your participation in the project. This article outlines the types of accounts that you are likely to have, what they are for, and how you go about resetting passwords on each of them.

===== Your OUNetID (4x4) Account =====

Before you can even sign-up on create.ou.edu, you must have an OUNetID (4x4) account. This account is used by you initially for only one purpose: signing up for your domain and hosting. In addition, at some point in the future (usually upon graduating or leaving OU), you may need to login to this account again in order to transfer your domain so that you take over ownership of it. 

To access your OUNetID (4x4) Account: 

* Visit https://accounts.ou.edu.
* If it is your first time in the OUNetID (4x4) Account, go to https://accounts.ou.edu and click **Iâ€™m New to OU**.

The first time you access your OUNetID (4x4) Account, you will set a password for it. On subsequent logins, you can use that same password. If you forget your password, you can go to accounts.ou.edu and click the **Reset Password** link. 

**Bottom Line:** You MUST use this account at least once before signing-up for create.ou.edu.

===== Your cPanel Account =====

When you first sign-up for your domain and hosting, a cPanel account will be generated that provides you with access to your slice of the create.ou.edu Web server. Your cPanel account is automatically associated with your OUNetID (4x4) account. Therefore, **your OUNetID (4x4) account credentials will grant you access to your cPanel account**.

===== Your Application Administrator Accounts =====

Every time you install a new application in cPanel, an Administrator Account for that application will be created. You will likely use these accounts very often -- every time you need to login to your application to manage the associated Web site, you will use this account. 

For example, if you install WordPress to manage your Web site, every time you need to add content to WordPress, change your theme, approve comments, etc. you will use this account to login. 

Usually, you will be given the opportunity to choose the userid and password for that account. We recommend choosing something that you are likely to remember but that is [[http://lifehacker.com/184773/geek-to-live--choose-and-remember-great-passwords|strong and secure]]. 

Upon installation, you will likely receive an email confirming the userid/password combination you chose. It will also have information about how to access the login page for that application. You may wish to make sure you don't delete this message. 

Depending on the application you're working with, managing and resetting the password for this account will vary. If you've used Installatron (in cPanel) to install the application, however, you can always review the account credentials: 

* Login to cPanel through https://create.ou.edu.
* Click the Installatron icon in the Software/Services section. 
* Find the application you installed under **My Applications**. 
* Click the **Edit** button (this looks like a blue wrench). 
* Scroll down to find the Administrator Username and Password. 

In addition, most applications should have some kind of password reset link on the login page. 

===== Other Types of Accounts =====

In addition to the three account types outlined above, there are a few other kinds of accounts you may have as part of create.ou.edu: 

* Email: If you set up an email address at your domain, you will have an account associated with this. 
* FTP: If you set up FTP on your account, you will need to set up an account. 
* Application User Accounts: In addition to the Administrator Account that you set up when installing an application, most applications will also let you set up user accounts.
